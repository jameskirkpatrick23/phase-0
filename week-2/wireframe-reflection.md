What is a wireframe?
A wireframe is a basic template of what a website will look like. It allows you to make major design changes without messing with the actual site.

What are the benefits of wireframing?
You have complete control over a wireframe, can recieve feedback from stakeholders, and can use the agreed upon design to shape the code you later write

Did you enjoy wireframing your site?
It was a lot of fun actually. I did get a little lazy after the third style of frame, however I think I realy came up with a website idea that fits my personality

Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?
There were a heck of a lot of revisions, but the core designed stayed generally the same.

What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
Why am I making this site, what am I trying to protrait about myself, what am I trying to make people do or see while on the site, what is my audience. I used the video from 2.1 a lot. That lady was pretty awesome.

Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?
I enjoyed the whole thing actualy. It makes the idea of having your own website suddenly believable

Here are the pictures from the wireframing that I worked on (Hover tooltip for descriptions):
