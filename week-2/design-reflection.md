What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?
The 6 Phases of Web Design are Information Gathering, Planning, Design, Development, Testing and Delivery, and Maintenance

What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
My site's primary goal is to be a professional snapshot of me. It will be geared towards a professional audience, and as such should include information about myself, contact information, a portfolio of my past works, and future endeavors, as well as a running blog to show updates on my works.

What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
The target audience will be interested in viewing my proficencies in website development, including ux and ui design. I will make an incredibly user friendly design, and add nuances such as mobile and cross-browser support to show that I know what I am doing, while supplementing the website itself with my own portfolio.

What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
The action that people should take is contacting me, and gathering information about my capabilities as a web developer.

What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
For one, trust your eyes. Second, make sure to gather the goal behind the website, and the target audience. It doesn't matter how cool your website might be if it doesn't accomplish what it is supposed to. Finally, things should be easy for the user to access. They shouldn't have to jump through hoops just to access one bit of information, especially if it is important to the website purpose.

What is user experience design and why is it valuable? 
User experience or UX is the research, study, and implmentation of strategies designed to make a user friendly website that is visually appealing, simple to use, and makes the user want to come back. It ultimately can protect or increase revenue if aspects of a website are designed well, such as a checkout or cart method for online purchases.

Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
I really didn't find anything tedious. If anything, I actually found them to be quite fun!
