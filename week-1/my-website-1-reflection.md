#Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
by clicking on the small + in the top right hand corner of github.com you can create a repository for yourself. then in the command prompt you simply type: git clone URL

#Describe what open source means.
open source means that anyone can access the actual code behind a product, website, or service. this allows multiple individuals to work on a project and add any kind of additions they see fit. it further allows them to convince the author to adapt their changes if they are good enough

#What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
i like the idea of open source. i am a pretty trusting person as it is, and would certainly let others adapt my code, or help me make corrections if they felt it would help me accomplish the goals I want

#Assess the importance of using licenses.
I did not fully understand this one so far, and will be asking more questions in office hours tomorrow about it. however what I do know is that the MIT style allows for open sourced projects where anyone can use it. I guess by deduction, other types of licenses would be closed so that only the author can make changes/see the code.

#What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
I definitely felt satisfaction in seeing the tangible result of "HEY THERE DBC" show up on my desktop url. that was really cool. I guess some of the aha moments came when pushing things onto the server. for whatever reason they kind of just made sense after a little. I struggled a little when I forgot to initially create a secondary branch to work on, I was initially working only in the master branch which is a no-no. so for practice I deleted everything and started again on a new branch.
