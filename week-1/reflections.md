#Learning about something and fully making a connection to that knowledge are two vastly different things. I slearned about many of the productivity and time management skills there, however the one that I connected to he most was certainly the idea that "confidence is just displayed ability". It truly struck home to me for more reasons than I care to count. It really hones in on my own perceptions of how good certain people seem at what they do, and how upon trying something new confidence can be hard to come by.

Time boxing is the idea that you work until a certain time-limit is achieved, then pause to reflect upon what happened during that time. This helps to break up and give perspective to work especially when learning.

I currently use a slightly different method to those mentioned above. I tend to set up small tasks for myself and at the completion of each task, take a 5 minute break. By allowing myself that time to catch my breath before starting something new, I am able to not only keep my sanity, but continue to let my brain work at peek effectiveness. I do believe this strategy is currently working,and I plan to keep using it. The only problem that I can see myself getting into is when a task that I feel should be simple becomes complex and causes me to spend too much time on it without allowing my brain a break.

I will certainly try to utilize the time-box method as it is similar to mine, and that it can easily be accomplished by setting a timer on a cell phone or watch.

Overall, I plan to effectively manage my time by breaking everything down into simple tasks. By taking things just one step at a time, I can allow myself to keep working without burning out in the coming months.

##Well first things first, I am not a huge fan of the command line interface. It scares the heck out of me. No real rational reason for it, yet it still does. With that off my chest I can begin with what I think a shell is. A shell to me is a blank outline of your computer. It houses all the files and directories that your PC or Mac stores and allows a program such as Bash to utilize their directories. Bash is a very simple program that utilizes the command line to access, change, and use data currently being stored in the shell.

Probably the most challenging thing for me was the fact that I had no idea what I was doing for most of it. Towards the end I think I gained a small level of understanding, but then promptly lost it again when it came time to use the text editor. I became very confused as to how I would even go about using that with the programs we were provided in the course. 

I was able to use all of the commands, however it required me to use Windows Powershell in certain situations as I couldn't figure out how to make or find a text file to make half the stuff the crash course wanted. I will definitely be asking questions about this part in the office hours tomorrow.

I can certainly see the importance of the wildcard, pwd, and the piping functions. They would allow programmers huge amounts of knowledge and at the same time giving them tools to manipulate data in new and efficient ways.

pwd- print working directory basically prints where you are in the computer

ls- list whats in the directory

mv- move something (file or directory)

cd- change directory. only reason i know this is the number of times i had to type /home/vagrant...

../- i have no idea

touch- prints something you tell it to

mkdir- makes a new directory under the one you are currently in

less- scrolls through things i think?

rmdir- deletes a directory (MUST NOT HAVE ANYTHING IN IT)

rm- removes files

help- apparently the guy thought this function was silly, but its designed to find help in certain sections

### first and foremost, I would make sure that people actually understand what they can do. I had a lot of trouble, and unnecessary frustration trying to figure out how to find all the files on my computer when using a virtual machine. Turns out I just had to use windows powershell. who knew right? also, thank you so much Mike. You are a godsend for helping me out with that.

as for answering the question in its entirety, I would say "it's easy!" first, you need to make a file that you want to work on. After that, you would have to save it to github. (I am unsure if this would be where you would initiate git, then commit the file. i believe that it possibly what we are supposed to do, but not sure) . From there, forking is as easy as 1,2,3! All you ahve to do is go under the file settings on github and hit the fork button!!! from there you might have to click on a few extra small things like MIT formatting, but its pretty straightforward. Next you look at the middle right side of the screen and copy the URL of the file you just forked. then, all you have to do to get it on your computer is type "git init" to your command line, followed by "git clone whateverurliwantedtocopy". Viola! you have a new fully functioning clone of the thing you wanted!

My struggles were mentioned above, and were mainly misunderstanding what I was allowed to work with in terms of hardward that caused a lot of problems. But at the end of the day, the office hours with mike helped out and I was able to complete it with little trouble afterwords!
