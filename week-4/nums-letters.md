1)How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?

Ruby handles them similar to most other programming languages. It uses regular PEMDAS, and allows for the user to create variables that point to various intigers or floats in their equations. An example is used here in the Basic Math challenge: https://github.com/jkirkpatrick1990/phase-0/blob/master/week-4/basic-math.rb

2)What is the difference between integers and floats?

The difference between integers and floats is pretty simple. Floats have decimal places, intigers do not. Floats are very similar to integers, however because they utilize decimal places, they are more important in academis rather than everyday life. For example, I cannot buy just a half of a car. A float would make no sense in itemizing the number of cars on a lot. However, integers would fit perfectly. Vice versa, it would not make sense to round down all the time on moneywhen a customer is checking out a cart, so floats should be used in those instances.

3)What is the difference between integer and float division?

There aren't too many differences in the division processes, however one key difference is the prevalance of the modulus, or remainder, function. The modulus function, represented by % will give the remainder of a division when the numbers do not divide evenly. For example, in the basic math challenge linked in #1, you will see that the modulus of 80 and 45 is the remainder of 35. If you were to just divide them as an integer, you would recieve an answer of 1. By using modulus you can see the remaining portion you have after your initial division.

3)What are strings? Why and when would you use them?

Strings are a series of characters, typically non-numeric, that are put into a container. They can be manipulated in several ways, including but not limited to: case, content, and order. In this challenge you can see several different string manipulations in order to create a desired result. https://github.com/jkirkpatrick1990/phase-0/blob/master/week-4/simple-string.rb

4)What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?

Local variables are variables created only within the program itself. Those variables will be deleted upon exiting that portion of the program. For example, if we have a method that we use to call an addition on some pair of numbers. We might have a local variable that temporarily stores that solution. Once we finish calling that method however, the local variable is destroyed. If we were to use a global variable however, the values would remain even after the method is called. Take a look at the examples here for a better look https://github.com/jkirkpatrick1990/phase-0/blob/master/week-4/defining-variables.rb.

5)How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?

Overall, this challenge was more of a nusiance than a true challenge. It was certainly a good refresher, and I was glad to have the chance to do it. However, there was certainly some frustration in the setup of having to do each section on a new file. Overall however, I see the importance and am thankful that I completed it.
