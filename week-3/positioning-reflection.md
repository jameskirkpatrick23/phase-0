How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?
It allows you to manipulate the attributes of an HTML element within the dev tools before ever having to create the code behind it. You can see what your final product would look like if you add the changes. Furthermore, it has the padding margin and border tools added into it.

How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?
Changing the width, height, borders, and padding.

What are the differences between Absolute, Fixed, Static, and Relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? 
Which was most difficult?
Absolute positioning means that no matter what the page does, that element will stay in the position it was originally defined in..
Fixed means that regardless of how far up or down on a page you are, the element will display in the same location.
Static is the generic position. The element will have a defined initial position, however it can be moved around based on screen zoom etc.
Relative positioning deals with an elements position in regards to the items near it on the heirarchy. It will leave itself in position near or between those elements.
Most difficult to use was the relative positioning.

What are the differences between Margin, Border, and Padding?
Margin deals with the amount of space between the borders of two or more elements.
Border deals with the size and shape of the border around an element.
Padding is the space between the content of the element and the border that contains it.

What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)
I liked the challenge. It allowed us to play around a lot more with dev-tools and see how valuable they can be.
