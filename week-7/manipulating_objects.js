// Manipulating JavaScript Objects

// I worked on this challenge: [by myself, with: ]

// There is a section below where you will write your code.

// DO NOT ALTER THIS OBJECT BY ADDING ANYTHING WITHIN THE CURLY BRACES!
var terah = {
  name: "Terah",
  age: 32,
  height: 66,
  weight: 130,
  hairColor: "brown",
  eyeColor: "brown"
}
// __________________________________________
// Write your code below.
var adam = {
  name: "Adam"
}
terah.spouse = adam
terah.weight = 125
terah.eyeColor = undefined
terah.spouse.spouse = terah
terah.children = new Object
terah.children.carson = new Object
terah.children.carson.name = "Carson"
terah.children.carter = new Object
terah.children.carter.name = "Carter"
terah.children.colton = new Object
terah.children.colton.name = "Colton"
adam.children = terah.children


// __________________________________________
// Reflection: Use the reflection guidelines

//What tests did you have trouble passing? What did you do to make it pass? Why did that work?
//  I had a lot of trouble initially in creating the children as new objects of Terah's children. I guess I really just didn't think about it correctly. Ultimately I just created them as new objects using the .notation pathway to get to the right data then calling = new Object. I guess it worked because I was explicately telling the computer that the kid was a new object of children

// How difficult was it to add and delete properties outside of the object itself?
//  Suprisingly a lot easier than I had initially thought. .notation is pretty wonderful

// What did you learn about manipulating objects in this challenge?
//  Basically don't screw up your pathways and think logically. If you do those two things you will pass every test pretty easy
